I will build a responsive mobile-web application (Single Page Application) using **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS** to implement the "Wuxin" (吾心) app prototype.

### **1. Project Setup & Architecture**
*   **Framework**: React (Vite) for fast performance and component-based architecture.
*   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for rapid, modern styling that matches the "Chinese Zen" aesthetic (Teal, Gold, White, Cloud patterns).
*   **Icons**: Lucide-React for functional icons.
*   **State Management**: Simple React State to manage active tabs and "Under Development" notifications.

### **2. Visual Style & Assets**
*   **Theme**: I will implement the "Dynamic Aesthetic" described, focusing on the Teal/Cyan and Gold color palette visible in your design.
*   **Graphics**: Since I cannot directly save the images from the chat, I will recreate the visual elements (Clouds, Bagua, Calligraphy style text) using **CSS and SVGs** to ensure a high-quality, scalable look that matches your "Design Master Map".
*   **Responsive Design**: The app will be designed as a mobile-first web app (simulating a phone screen on desktop).

### **3. Functional Modules (Implementation Plan)**
I will create a main navigation structure corresponding to your 5 core modules + Global Interaction.

*   **Landing Page**: A "Splash Screen" matching your mockup (Logo "吾心", "Enter Meditation" button).
*   **Main Navigation (Bottom Tab Bar)**:
    1.  **知己 (Know Yourself)**:
        *   *Features*: Constitution Self-Test, Health Profile.
        *   *Action*: Clicking these will show the "Under Development" toast.
    2.  **修行 (Practice)**:
        *   *Features*: Five-Tone Therapy, 12-Hour Regimen, Ancient Wisdom Guide, Sleep Aid.
        *   *Action*: I will create a simple player UI for the "Five-Tone Therapy" but leave the audio source empty (as requested), showing a placeholder.
    3.  **心境 (State of Mind)**:
        *   *Features*: Smart Home Linkage, Bio-feedback.
        *   *Action*: Placeholder UI showing status.
    4.  **尘缘 (Connections)**:
        *   *Features*: Silent Group Practice, Meditation Partner (Game), Community.
        *   *Action*: Community feed mockups.
    5.  **拾趣 (Fun)**:
        *   *Features*: Leveling System, Sound Market, Fantasy Stories.
        *   *Action*: Grid layout of items.

### **4. Global Features**
*   **AI Assistant (心声伴侣)**: A floating action button that opens a chat interface mockup.
*   **Interaction Logic**: All buttons for unimplemented features will trigger a custom Toast notification: **“正在开发中，敬请期待！” (Under development, stay tuned!)**.

### **5. Execution Steps**
1.  Initialize the React project.
2.  Configure Tailwind CSS with the custom color palette (Teal: #0E7A83, Gold: #D4AF37, etc.).
3.  Implement the App Shell (Layout, Bottom Navigation).
4.  Build the 5 Module Pages with the content from your description.
5.  Implement the "Splash Screen" and transition to the main app.
6.  Add the "Under Development" interaction logic.
